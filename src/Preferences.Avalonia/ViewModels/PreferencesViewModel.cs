/// <remarks>
/// This class serves as the main view model for the preferences window, maintaining a collection of
/// <see cref="SectionViewModel"/> instances organized by their order property. It provides reactive 
/// property change notifications through ReactiveUI for UI binding.
/// 
/// The view model is initialized with a <see cref="PreferencesOptions"/> that contains the underlying
/// preference data structure, and an optional <see cref="ILocalizationService"/> for localizing 
/// section and entry titles.
/// 
/// It tracks the currently selected section to facilitate navigation between different preference
/// categories in the UI.
