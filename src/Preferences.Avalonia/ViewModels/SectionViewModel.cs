/// <summary>
/// Represents a view model for a preferences section that provides reactive UI binding
/// and localization support for preference entries.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This view model wraps a <see cref="PreferencesSection"/> model and exposes its properties
/// in a way that's suitable for UI binding in Avalonia applications. It implements
/// <see cref="IDisposable"/> to properly clean up event subscriptions and follows the
/// ReactiveUI pattern for property change notifications.
/// 
/// The view model automatically handles localization updates by subscribing to locale
/// change events and refreshing the Title property when the locale changes.
