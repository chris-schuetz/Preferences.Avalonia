/// This class serves as the top-level model for the preferences system, containing a collection
/// of <see cref="PreferencesSection"/> objects that group related preferences together.
/// 
/// PreferencesOptions is typically used when initializing the preferences UI system and provides
/// the complete preferences hierarchy for the application. It defines a constant string identifier
/// for preferences configuration.
/// 
/// The class follows a simple structure where all preference sections are stored in a flat list,
/// with each section containing its own entries. This design allows for flexible organization
/// of application settings while maintaining a consistent UI representation.
